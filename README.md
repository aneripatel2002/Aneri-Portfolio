Professional Portfolio Page


This is my second assignmnet and I have included HTML and CSS and have created multiple pages. I used what I have learned in the first two weeks of the bootcamp to write the HTML and CSS from scratch, while meeting the following requriements:
    -   it has multple sections
    -   inludes lot of pictures and links
    -   responsive page
    -   included some hover effects 
    -   has a link of my previous deployed Page

I hope I was able to understand the assignment and deliver it as requested.

Thank you
